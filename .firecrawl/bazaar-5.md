Getting discovered makes your endpoint available to tens of thousands of agents through CDP APIs,
the Bazaar MCP server, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, and to people browsing
[agentic.market](https://agentic.market/). The x402 Bazaar lists more than 23,000 x402 resources.In this guide, you’ll configure discovery metadata, validate your endpoint, and complete the paid
call that triggers indexing.When you build with the CDP SDK’s x402 building blocks, x402 Bazaar support is enabled
automatically. There is no registration form or separate API call.

## [​](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered\#configure-discovery-with-the-cdp-sdk)  Configure discovery with the CDP SDK

- TypeScript

- Python


For every route written as `"METHOD /path"`, `createX402Server`:

- Adds a minimal `extensions.bazaar` declaration derived from the method and path.
- Registers the x402 Bazaar resource-server extension.
- Connects the server to the CDP Facilitator.

You do not need to add a discovery setting. The route key must include a specific HTTP method and
an absolute path, such as `GET /report`. A wildcard method does not contain enough information for
the SDK to generate discovery metadata.

### [​](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered\#add-richer-discovery-metadata)  Add richer discovery metadata

The generated declaration is enough for a route without inputs. For any route that accepts query
parameters, path parameters, or a request body, we strongly recommend adding explicit schemas and
examples — without them, agents can discover your endpoint but can’t construct a valid call. Use
`declareDiscoveryExtension` and pass its result as the route’s `extensions` value:

```
import { createX402Server } from "@coinbase/cdp-sdk/x402";
import { declareDiscoveryExtension } from "@x402/extensions/bazaar";

const server = await createX402Server({
  routes: {
    "GET /weather/:city": {
      price: "$0.01",
      description: "Get current weather conditions for a city",
      extensions: {
        ...declareDiscoveryExtension({
          method: "GET",
          pathParamsSchema: {
            properties: {
              city: {
                type: "string",
                description: "City name slug, such as san-francisco",
              },
            },
            required: ["city"],
          },
          output: {
            example: {
              city: "san-francisco",
              conditions: "foggy",
              temperature: 60,
            },
          },
        }),
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Your explicit `bazaar` declaration replaces the minimal declaration generated for that
route. Provide accurate examples and JSON Schemas so buyers and agents can construct valid
requests before paying.For a runnable version, see the
[TypeScript Express server example](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk/tree/main/examples/typescript/x402/servers/express)
(`APPROACH=3` loads routes from a config file, the same shape used above). Every route it declares
through `createX402Server` is Bazaar-discoverable automatically. See the
[CDP SDK x402 reference](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/sdks/cdp-sdks-v2/typescript/x402/index) for all server configuration
options.

The Python CDP SDK does not ship a `createX402Server` equivalent, so there is no automatic
discovery. Instead, build the standard [x402](https://pypi.org/project/x402/) server stack and
swap in the CDP Facilitator with `create_facilitator_config` from the CDP SDK’s `cdp.x402`
module. Discovery is opt-in: you register the Bazaar resource-server extension and declare
metadata for each route yourself. See the
[Bazaar extension](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/tree/main/python/x402/extensions/bazaar)
for the extension implementation.Because there is no minimal auto-generated declaration, every discoverable route must supply
its own metadata through `declare_discovery_extension`:

```
from cdp.x402 import create_facilitator_config
from x402.extensions.bazaar import (
    OutputConfig,
    bazaar_resource_server_extension,
    declare_discovery_extension,
)
from x402.http import HTTPFacilitatorClient, PaymentOption
from x402.http.middleware.fastapi import PaymentMiddlewareASGI
from x402.http.types import RouteConfig
from x402.mechanisms.evm.exact import ExactEvmServerScheme
from x402.server import x402ResourceServer

# Swap in the CDP Facilitator: create_facilitator_config() reads CDP_API_KEY_ID /
# CDP_API_KEY_SECRET and authenticates verify/settle against the CDP Facilitator.
server = x402ResourceServer(HTTPFacilitatorClient(create_facilitator_config()))
server.register("eip155:84532", ExactEvmServerScheme())

# Opt into discovery: register the Bazaar extension, then declare metadata per route.
server.register_extension(bazaar_resource_server_extension)

routes = {
    "GET /weather/:city": RouteConfig(
        accepts=[\
            PaymentOption(\
                scheme="exact",\
                pay_to=EVM_ADDRESS,\
                price="$0.01",\
                network="eip155:84532",\
            )\
        ],
        description="Get current weather conditions for a city",
        extensions=declare_discovery_extension(
            path_params_schema={
                "properties": {
                    "city": {"type": "string", "description": "City name slug"}
                },
                "required": ["city"],
            },
            output=OutputConfig(
                example={"city": "san-francisco", "conditions": "foggy", "temperature": 60}
            ),
        ),
    ),
}

app.add_middleware(PaymentMiddlewareASGI, routes=routes, server=server)
```

Provide accurate examples and JSON Schemas so buyers and agents can construct valid requests
before paying. For a runnable version, see the
[Python Bazaar server example](https://github.com/coinbase/cdp-sdk/blob/main/examples/python/x402/servers/bazaar.py).

## [​](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered\#validate-your-endpoint)  Validate your endpoint

After deploying the route to a public HTTPS URL, use the validation endpoint to check that
it:

- Is reachable.
- Returns `402 Payment Required`.
- Advertises a valid `extensions.bazaar` block.
- Would be accepted by the CDP Facilitator for indexing.

```
curl -X POST https://api.cdp.coinbase.com/platform/v2/x402/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resource": "https://api.example.com/report",
    "method": "GET"
  }'
```

No API key is required. A successful response has `valid: true` and
`simulation.outcome: "accepted"`. Review `preflight` for required failures and advisory
recommendations, and inspect `bazaarExtension` to confirm the metadata served by your
endpoint.For the complete request and response schema, see
[Validate x402 endpoint](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/api-reference/v2/rest-api/x402-facilitator/validate-x402-endpoint).

## [​](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered\#get-featured-curation-tiers)  Get featured: curation tiers

Every validated endpoint is eligible for indexing in the CDP Bazaar after a successful settled
payment. A hand-selected slice of the highest-quality endpoints is additionally **curated** and
featured to buyers and agents. Curation is how you go from indexed to distributed.Curation is separate from ranking. Ranking orders results within the Bazaar based on real
economic usage and listing quality over a rolling 30-day window; new endpoints rank
conservatively until usage accrues.

### [​](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered\#requirements-for-curation)  Requirements for curation

Meeting these qualifies an endpoint for review — listing remains editorial, based on
service quality, category coverage, and ecosystem fit.

| Requirement | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Live payments** | Accepting live x402 payments on mainnet. |
| **Availability** (30-day, platform-measured) | ≥ 99%. Endpoints above 99.5% receive priority placement. |
| **Health** | Passes the platform health probe. Sustained consecutive failures auto-delist the endpoint (see below). |
| **Agent-ready metadata** | Complete input schema; a description that tells an agent _when_ to use the endpoint; per-call pricing, supported networks, and documented error responses. |
| **Verified** | Passes [validation](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered#validate-your-endpoint). |

### [​](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered\#staying-curated)  Staying curated

Curated endpoints are health-probed on a regular interval. An endpoint that fails
consecutive probes is first down-ranked and then dropped from the featured tier; it
remains discoverable in the general Bazaar and is automatically restored once it recovers.
Endpoints that stop returning `402 Payment Required` are eventually removed from the index
entirely.

Complete these steps before you expect your route to appear in the Bazaar:

- [ ]  Deploy your route to a public HTTPS URL.
- [ ] [Validate the endpoint](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered#validate-your-endpoint).
- [ ]  For routes that accept inputs, [add schemas and examples](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered#add-richer-discovery-metadata).
- [ ]  Complete a successful paid call through the CDP Facilitator.

## [​](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered\#troubleshooting-discovery)  Troubleshooting discovery

How do I tell whether my discovery metadata was accepted?

The CDP Facilitator reports the outcome on verify and settle responses in an
`EXTENSION-RESPONSES` header. The value is base64-encoded JSON keyed by extension name, and the
`bazaar` key carries a `status` of `success`, `processing`, or `rejected`:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `success` | The metadata was validated and cataloged. |
| `processing` | The metadata was accepted and is being cataloged asynchronously. |
| `rejected` | The metadata was refused. Read `rejectedReason` for the cause. |

Rejections are usually strict JSON Schema validation: your declared `input` must validate
against `schema.properties.input`. The settle request also has to carry
`paymentPayload.resource`, because without it the Bazaar has no resource to attach the
metadata to.

Many different URLs collapsed into a single Bazaar entry

The Bazaar normalizes any path segment that consists entirely of a high-cardinality
identifier: a UUID, an EVM address, an EVM transaction hash, a Solana address, or a Solana
transaction hash. Each such segment becomes a generic route template parameter, so
`/data/0xabc.../report` and `/data/0x123.../report` surface as one entry rather than two.To keep each resource listed separately, add a prefix or suffix so the segment is not a bare
identifier, such as `/user-<uuid>` instead of `/<uuid>`.

My ranking has not moved since my last payment

Quality metrics (buyer reach, transaction volume, and recency) are recomputed on a six-hour
schedule, so a newly settled payment does not change your position right away. Allow up to six
hours for a ranking change to appear in search results.

My endpoint dropped out of the Bazaar

Resources that go 30 days without a settlement are removed from both the catalog and search
results, so a listed route needs ongoing traffic to stay listed. Availability matters
separately: see [Staying curated](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/seller/get-discovered#staying-curated) for the health probe behavior that
down-ranks and then removes endpoints that stop responding.

My endpoint is indexed but ranks poorly

Ranking weighs listing quality alongside real usage. Three things are under your control:

- **Description.** Write a natural-language description of what the endpoint does and when to
call it. Bare endpoint names and placeholder text score zero on metadata quality. Keep it to
500 characters or fewer, because the CDP Facilitator rejects verify and settle requests
whose description exceeds that limit.
- **Schemas and examples.** Complete input and output schemas with realistic examples raise
metadata quality and let an agent construct a valid request without guessing.
- **Hosting.** Resources on shared tunneling domains such as `ngrok.io` are weighted below
those on dedicated domains, and results are capped per domain so no single provider floods
a query.

I want a paid route to stay out of the Bazaar

Only routes that declare Bazaar metadata are indexed. In Python, discovery is opt-in, so a
route stays unlisted as long as you do not declare metadata for it. In TypeScript,
`createX402Server` derives a declaration for every route key written as `"METHOD /path"`, so
keeping a paid route unlisted means assembling that server from the `@x402` packages directly
instead.

How do I test discovery before going to mainnet?

Run against the CDP Facilitator on Base Sepolia or Solana Devnet. The same discovery endpoints
surface testnet resources once verify and settle have run through CDP. The
[x402.org facilitator](https://x402.org/facilitator) maintains its own separate catalog, which
is not the CDP Bazaar.

For payment and settlement failures that are not specific to discovery, see
[Troubleshooting](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/support/troubleshooting).
