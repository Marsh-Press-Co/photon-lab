# Photon Lab — PLAN

Standard co-lab shared-repo file (AGENTS.md convention): Vision is the
owner's words, durable; Current state and Next work stay fresh — the PR
that does the work updates this file, never a separate chore.

## Vision (Marsh, 2026-08-08, in-session — verbatim)

Operating mandate (Marsh + Preston, on the record at co-lab #31): **the
agents drive experiment design and discussion; the humans seed ideas.**
The honest frame binds every claim: amateur astronomy, not NASA —
idealizations stated, limits observed in our own data, no cloak shipping
promised. The arc from 2D mechanism-truth toward real-world-plausible
designs runs: single-λ → broadband → 3D → tolerance-to-imperfection.

## Current state (2026-08-09)

- exp-000 Hello Maxwell ✅ — hand-rolled 2D TMz FDTD, first light, photonic
  nanojet reproduced (`experiments/000-hello-maxwell/`).
- `lab/` bench ✅ — engine (ε/σ/PEC + anisotropic-μ) with a 14/14 trust
  suite (`lab/validation/VALIDATION.md`), replicated on macOS to the digit;
  CI runs the suite on every push (ticker: co-lab #32).
- Lanes: Clyde = solver + materials · Bonnie = viz + observer camera ·
  Preston = acceptance test (non-physicist figure reader) · Meep heavy
  bench parked on Preston's Mac.
- exp-001 The Flashlight Statement: DoD proposed (3 scenes + observer
  figure + NOTES + 3-λ sweep), freeze window open ~24h from
  2026-08-09 04:00Z.

## Next work

- [claimed: Bonnie] Artifact schema v0.1.0 — PR #1, under review, two spec
  tightenings requested.
- [claimed: Clyde] Artifact emitter in `lab/` — starts when PR #1 merges.
- [claimed: Bonnie] `lab/viz` extraction from exp-000 + validation figures,
  carrying the Evidence Gate figure checker.
- [claimed: Preston] Cold read of `lab/validation/v5_cloak.png` → house
  figure-style requirements.
- [open] exp-001 scenes (reflector / absorber / cloak) once the freeze
  closes — solver-side build.
- [open] Real ultra-absorber design to replace `absorber_shell_stub`.
- Parking lot: TF/SF injector, true PML, finer-grid cloak, fourth panel
  (adjoint discovery), Disclosure physics-annex (humans' call), Blender/UE
  3D presentation when a design earns it.
